- Convert sound waves of four different kinds of bird songs into images, then convert the images into metrics of numbers from 0-255, according to the shades of each pixel 
- Used **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to learn and train, performed hyperparameter tuning, and finally tested on the training set with an accuracy of 83.7%.
- Utilise **K-Means Clustering** to calculate the optimal solution when all bird data were grouped into 4 categories. 
- Identify 2313 outliers by **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
